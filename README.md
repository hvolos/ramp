Replication-Aware Memory-error Protection (RAMP) offers a framework for designing and analyzing two-tier memory resilience schemes, where an upper memory-replication tier is used to handle errors that a lower memory-protection tier cannot tolerate. RAMP provides analytical models that enable system designers and operators to understand the interaction between the two protection tiers and assess how
the lower tierâ€™s protection strength affects the overall protection provided by multiple replicas in the upper tier. 

## Resilience Evaluation

Use model/ to reason about resilience of two-tier protection scheme. 

## Performance Evaluation

Configure CloudLab r320 machines, with Linux kernel 4.4 and Mellanox OFED 4.1.

Use test.py to deploy Hydra, Memcached, and conduct synthetic fault injection experiments

### Verifying Memcached session 

Verify Memcached is running on the manager node

List all sessions:
tmux ls

Attach to session
tmux at -t mysession

Detach from session
CTRL+B then D

### Verifying memory cgroup

Verify memctl memory limit

cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memctl/memory.limit_in_bytes

Verify memcached running under memctl cgroup

cat /proc/$(ps aux | grep memcached | grep users | awk '{print $2}')/cgroup

### Checking swap usage

swapon -s

### Configuring fault injection

Setting fault rate

```
echo 1000 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/config/hydra/hydrahost0/hydra0/fault_injection_distr
sudo cat /sys/kernel/config/hydra/hydrahost0/hydra0/fault_injection_distr
```

Enabling fault injection

```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/config/hydra/hydrahost0/hydra0/fault_injection_enable
```
